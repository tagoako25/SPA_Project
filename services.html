                        <h1>Our Spa Services</h1>
                        <p>Serenity Spa offers many services to help relax, refresh, and recharge your body, from head-to-toe.</p>

                        <p>
                            It is appreciated if changes or cancellations be made at least 72 hours in advance. To make up for the lost time that was reserved, a 50% surcharge of the service price will be assessed if you cancel or reschedule with less than 48 hours' notice. This is valid for all scheduled spa services and packages. 100% of the service will be charged in the event of a NO SHOW. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Spa Massage</h3>
                        <p>Take time to unwind with Torontoâ€™s leading day spa massage services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the earliest and most basic types of therapy is massage, which involves pressing, kneading, and caressing the body in order to tone, relax, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. It also affects the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissues. Relaxation massage improves the body's ability to eliminate waste by stimulating blood circulation and supporting the lymphatic system.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Body Treatments</h3>
                        <p>Relax, refresh and recharge with your preferred signature service or full body treatment at Serenity Spa.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Your entire body benefits greatly from body treatments. It is equally crucial to cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize your skin, much like a facial. After receiving body treatments, your skin feels soft, smooth, and toned.

                        <p>
                            Taking care of your facial skin is essential to fending against environmental damage. Frequent facial treatments help to renew and revitalize the skin, and for optimal results, a customized home maintenance regimen must be followed to guarantee long-term outcomes. Maintaining healthy, young skin requires daily care. Your skin type and condition will determine what our Skin Care Specialist thinks is ideal for you.
